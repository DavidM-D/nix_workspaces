This is a collection of my development environments

If you want to work on a project with a rust and haskell component use the code below.

#+begin_src nix
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {}, ... }:
let
  workspaces_src = pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {
    owner = "DavidM-D";
    repo = "nix_workspaces";
    rev = "04f6bfe8ec9362614a934f4a9fed604c6fe7a5e3";
    sha256 = "1xjv25m6zjy2vfqav5w78zgs2xd8y10vll7xd92b7zg25h011wxv";
  };
  workspaces = import workspaces_src {inherit pkgs;};
  shell = with workspaces; merge_envs [rust haskell];
in shell
#+end_src

Currently this is about as long as the thing you're trying to import, so I wouldn't actually advise anyone uses it.
